          note: "PANELRIB® 1110 is suitable for both interior and exterior applications. When used for ceilings, proper support spacing is critical—consult engineering specifications. The subtle rib profile provides acoustic benefits in interior spaces. For food-grade or cleanroom applications, specify appropriate coating systems. Not designed for roofing applications. Installation orientation affects performance—vertical for walls, horizontal for ceilings. Fire rating varies by installation method and substrate."
